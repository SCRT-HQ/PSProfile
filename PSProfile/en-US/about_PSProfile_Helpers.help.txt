SHORT DESCRIPTION
    An overview of the Helper functions in PSProfile.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PSProfile Helpers are functions that enable easier integration
    with PSProfile.

    These include functions to make prompt customization easier
    as well as functions for Plugin developers to leverage to
    perform tasks like adding to the PSProfile log with
    `Write-PSProfileLog` or provide argument completers with
    `Get-PSProfileArguments`.

COMMANDS
    * `Get-LastCommandDuration`
        Gets the duration last command as a timestamp string for
        use in prompts.

    * `Get-PathAlias`
        Gets the shortened Path Alias for use in prompts.

    * `Get-PSProfileArguments`
        Gets argument completers from PSProfile, e.g. the list of
        prompt names for prompt management functions.

    * `Get-PSVersion`
        Gets the PSVersion as an easy to read string, including the
        ability to specify the number of decimal places to limit the
        resulting version string to.

    * `Test-IfGit`
        Tests if the current path is a Git repo folder and returns
        contextual information about it if so. Useful for prompts.

    * `Write-PSProfileLog`
        Writes a PSProfileEvent to the `$PSProfile.Log`. Useful for
        custom plugins so that logging remains lightweight and
        centralized.
