SHORT DESCRIPTION
    An overview of the Project Paths concept in PSProfile.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Project Paths are stored as an array of strings in the PSProfile
    object property `$PSProfile.ProjectPaths`. This property is
    intended for any folders which contain Git repo folders underneath
    them.

    Git repos found within the Project Path directories are added
    to the hashtable `$PSProfile.GitPathMap` with the folder name as the
    key and the full path as the value for each. Various functions
    leverage this dictionary for argument completers, especially in the
    functions in the included `PSProfile.PowerTools` plugin. Example
    functions that make use of this dictionary are `Open-Code`,
    `Push-Path` and `Open-Item`.

    Any `build.ps1` files found in these folders will also be added to
    a second hashtable `$PSProfile.PSBuildPathMap`. This enables
    tab-completion of common build script paths when using
    `Start-BuildScript` from `PSProfile.PowerTools`.

    These paths are searched for projects during the PSProfile refresh
    only. If you add a new Project Path, it is recommended to run
    `Update-PSProfileConfig` to immediately refresh your path dictionaries.
