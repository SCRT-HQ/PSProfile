SHORT DESCRIPTION
    An overview of the Variables concept in PSProfile.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Variables are stored as a hashtable in the PSProfile object
    property `$PSProfile.SymbolicLinks`. Variables in PSProfile are
    scoped to either Environment or Global.

    Each variable scope's value is a hashtable with each key-value
    pair correlating to a variable name as its key and the variable
    value as its value.

    Variables are set as the specified scope during PSProfile load.
