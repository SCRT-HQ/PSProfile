    about_PSProfile_Script_Paths

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    An overview of the Script Paths concept in PSProfile.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Script Paths are stored as an array of strings in the PSProfile
    object property `$PSProfile.ScriptPaths`.

    The Script Paths are invoked during PSProfile load. Any functions
    in the scripts will be imported at the Global scope so they are
    available in the current session after PSProfile finishes loading.

COMMANDS
    * `Add-PSProfileScriptPath`
        Adds a new Script Path to your PSProfile.

    * `Get-PSProfileScriptPath`
        Gets a Script Path or the list of Script Paths from
        your PSProfile configuration.

    * `Remove-PSProfileScriptPath`
        Removes a Script Path from your PSProfile.
