SHORT DESCRIPTION
    An overview of the Configuration functions in PSProfile.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PSProfile contains certain functions aimed at managing the PSProfile
    configuration itself. These are primarily wrapping methods on the PSProfile
    object directly for convenience.

COMMANDS
    * `Export-PSProfileConfiguration`
        Exports the PSProfile configuration to the desired path for portability.

        *Any secrets stored in the `$PSProfile.Vault` will be exported, but
        will be unable to be decrypted on another machine or by another user on
        the same machine due to encryption via Data Protection API.*

    * `Import-PSProfile`
        Invokes `$PSProfile.Load()` to run through the actions typically performed
        during the initial import of PSProfile. Useful when adding new items to
        PSProfile mid-session.

    * `Import-PSProfileConfiguration`
        Used when importing a non-standard configuration from a specific path,
        e.g. one you have migrated from another machine.

    * `Save-PSProfile`
        Invokes `$PSProfile.Save()` to save your current PSProfile object back
        to the Configuration file.

    * `Update-PSProfileConfig`
        Invokes `$PSProfile.Refresh()` which runs PSProfile tasks that are not
        intended to run often, such as Project Path discovery or module
        installation. This is normally done on a specified
        frequency (default is 1 hour), calling this function will refresh your
        PSProfile on command. Useful if you've just updated your PSProfile and
        would like to refresh it's configuration to reflect the new addition.

    * `Update-PSProfileRefreshFrequency`
        Updates the Refresh Frequency for PSProfile. Refreshes are performed
        during the next PSProfile load after the Refresh Frequency timespan has
        passed since the last refresh, e.g. if your last refresh was greater than
        1 hour ago and your Refresh Frequency is set to 01:00:00, a refresh will
        occur during the next PSProfile load automatically.

    * `Update-PSProfileSetting`
        Allows updating a specific setting directly on your PSProfile.
